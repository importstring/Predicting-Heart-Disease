# Predicting Heart Disease 

Currently, I have three submissions. First just as a quick base I did logistic regression. Then I moved onto GMB. I found that the LGMB was the most effective for this. I then tuned it. I create 3 new features to increase the accuracy and it did on my test set but on the competetion it made my accuracy go down. I decided to stop at that point because I did my research and some values were false.

All of my development is done inside `main.ipynb`

I'm using Python 3.10 for the best compatability.

To start

```
conda env create —file env.yml
conda activate heart
```

Use this virtual environment for the jupyter notebook. Note everything has already been run so you don't need to install anything to see the outputs.
