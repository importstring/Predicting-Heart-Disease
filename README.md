# Predicting Heart Disease 
Currently, I have three submissions. First just as a quick base I did logistic regression. Then I moved onto GMB. I found that the LGMB was the most effective for this. I then tuned it. After that, I did some feature engineering creating 3 new features. I stopped when the more accurate my model got, the lower my score—not because of overtraining but because there are false values added to the dataset.

All of my development is done inside `main.ipynb`

I'm using Python 3.10 for the best compatability.

To start

```
conda env create —file env.yml
conda activate heart
```

Use this virtual environment for the jupyter notebook. Note everything has already been run so you don't need to install anything to see the outputs.
