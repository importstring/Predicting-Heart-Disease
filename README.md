# Predicting Heart Disease 
Currently, I have three submissions. First just as a quick base I did logistic regression. Then I moved onto GMB. I found that the LGMB was the most effective for this. I then tuned it.

All of my development is done inside `main.ipynb`

I'm using Python 3.10 for the best compatability.

To start

```
conda env create —file env.yml
conda activate heart
```

Use this virtual environment for the jupyter notebook. Note everything has already been run so you don't need to install anything to see the outputs.
